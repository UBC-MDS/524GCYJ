# matrics_calculator

A package providing functions to calculate key regression metrics: R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Features

This package consists of four functions:
- `r_squared`:
    - This function calculates the R-squared of the model, which measures how well the model explains the variation in the data. 
- `mean_absolute_error`: 
    - This function finds the average difference between predicted and actual values.
- `mean_squared_error`:
    - This function calculates the average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values. 
- `mean_absolute_percentage_error`:
    - This function shows prediction error as a percentage, making it easy to understand.

##  matrics_calculator in the Python Ecosystem

`matrics_calculator` works alongside Python libraries like `scikit-learn` by providing simple implementations of regression metrics. Unlike `scikit-learn`â€™s full toolkit for modeling and evaluation, this package focuses only on metrics, making it easy to use for quick analysis or custom workflows.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install matrics_calculator
```
